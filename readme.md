# Assumptions
When stripping out the header an assumption is made that the seperator between the header and the data is a single blank line.

# Requirements
There are various Python modules that are required by these scripts. To install them run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
Place the "Sample A.xlsx" and or "Sample B.xlsx" files in the same directory as the .py scripts then execute the appropriate script. This can be done by opening the directory (containing the scripts) with a shell (command prompt, powershell, bash, etc) and running `py Sample_A.py` or `py Sample_B.py`. The resulting files will be placed in the same directory as the scripts.
